> **FYI**: This project uses **npm** as the package manager, but you're free to use **yarn** too.

## Development Installation

### Manual Installation

   npm install
   ```
5. Navigate into the server folder and install all its necessary dependencies with npm.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
6. Install PostgreSql and make sure it is running.

7. Configure environment variables:

    - Navigate to the /server directory.
    - Rename the .env.example file to .env.
    - Fill in the values for each key. Below is a guideline for filling the .env values:

Follow these steps to install the application locally:

11. Install the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)


### Docker Installation
Using Docker, you can have a complete, consistent development environment without having to manually install dependencies such as Node, Mongo, etc. It also helps isolate these dependencies and their data from other projects that you may have on the same computer that use different/conflicting versions, etc.

Note that this takes up a significant amount of space on your machine. Make sure you have at least 4GB free.

1. Install Docker for your operating system
   * [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
   * [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
2. Clone this repository and cd into it
3. Configure environment variables(Same as Manual Installation).
4. Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory, and run the following commands:

   ```sh 
   docker-compose build
   ```
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```
