            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Welcome to our site! We’re here to make money by selling your data, plain and simple. Read on to see how we turn your information into cash.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                We collect the following info because data is money:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-lg">
                <li>Your name and contact info (we need to know who we’re selling)</li>
                <li>Demographic information (the more we know, the more we make)</li>
                <li>Any other info you give us (we’re not picky, we’ll take it all)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How We Use the Information</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Here’s how we turn your info into cash:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-lg">
                <li>Internal record keeping (so we know who to sell next)</li>
                <li>Improving our products and services (to get more of your money)</li>
                <li>
                    Sending promotional emails (to tempt you into spending more)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Occasionally contacting you for market research (aka, figuring out how to get even more cash from you)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Security</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                We secure your data just enough to keep it valuable. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place, but let’s be real – if someone wants your data, they’ll find a way.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Cookies</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Cookies are tiny bits of data we plant on your device to track what you like. The more we know, the better we can target you with ads, and the more money we make. Agreeing to cookies means agreeing to be tracked for our profit.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Links to Other Websites</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Our site might link to other websites. Once you leave our site, you’re on your own. We can’t protect your data there, but those sites probably want your data too. It’s a data-selling free-for-all!
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Want to limit how we use your info? Here’s how you can try:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-lg">
                <li>
                    If you agreed to let us use your info for marketing, you can change your mind anytime by emailing us at [yashpalsinght9@gmail.com]. We might stop selling your data. Maybe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you think any info we have is wrong or incomplete, email us. We’ll fix it (after we stop laughing and counting our money).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                This privacy policy is subject to change without notice. We might find new ways to make money off your data, so check back often.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Our goal is simple: to make as much money as possible by selling your data to whoever will pay us. Thanks for your contribution to our bank account!
